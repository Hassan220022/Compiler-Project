# Compiler Project

A compiler is an essential tool in software development, acting as a translator for high-level source code into machine-readable instructions. This project focuses on implementing a compiler for a For-loop statement, covering crucial phases of compilation.

## General Phases

### Phase 1 (Lexical Analyzer)

In this phase, the source code is transformed into a set of tokens, including reserved words, special symbols, numbers, identifiers, and comments.

### Context-Free Grammar (CFG)

To progress to subsequent phases, a well-designed CFG is crucial. The CFG must be tailored to the specific structure of the given statement.

### Phase 2 (Syntax Analyzer)

This phase emphasizes the code's structure, constructing an abstract syntax tree.

### Phase 3 (Semantic Analyzer)

Checking the code's meaning and context to ensure alignment with the language's semantics. These initial phases enable the compiler to comprehend the code's structure and meaning.

### Example: `IF (X < Y) {X++}`

- High-level language
  - Lexical Analyzer (Tokenizer)
  - Syntax Analyzer (CFG, Parser)
  - Semantic Analyzer -> Semantic Tree

## The Parser

This project requires a Parse Tree parser, providing a geometrical representation of the derived string.

## The Statement

The specific statement implemented in this project is the For-loop statement.

```c
For (int X = 0; X <= 100; X++) 
{
    Sum += X;
}
```
## SIC Machine
The Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC) machine is a hypothetical computer architecture introduced by Leland Beck. It's a simplified model used for educational purposes. The SIC machine includes various instructions and features to demonstrate fundamental concepts of computer organization and programming.

## Requirements

- Display inputs and outputs for each phase.
- Print the designed CFG used by the parser.
- Provide a brief project report, including:
  - Simple pseudo-code or flowchart of the design.
  - Screenshots of mentioned inputs and outputs.
